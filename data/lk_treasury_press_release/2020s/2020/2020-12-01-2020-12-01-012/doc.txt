The Government’s Development Policy Framework, “Vistas of Prosperity and Splendor” envisages

harnessing the power of the country’s youth, who account for almost one fourth of the total population,

Improvement Program (SESIP). The above loan, which was borrowed at an annual interest rate of LIBOR

The proposed Secondary Education Sector Improvement Program (SESIP) will support the

Government’s General Education Sector Development Plan, 2020–2025 in strengthening the country’s

secondary education system. SESIP will institutionalize systems for enhancing secondary students’

learning outcomes through (i) enhancing the quality and relevance of secondary science, technology,

mathematics, and commerce (STMC) programs; (ii) strengthening provincial and school capacity to

implement education reforms; and (iii) strengthening sector management capacity.

The outcome of the Program will be the transformation of the education system as a basic foundation

for human resource development for a knowledge-based modern global economy in line with the national

policy framework. The SESIP also focuses on the new strategies such as online learning and teaching,

blended learning; distance mode education in line with the Government’s plan to address the COVID 19

disruptions.

The Ministry of Education will be the Executing Agency for the above Program, whereas the State Ministry

of Education Reforms, Open Universities and Distance Education Promotion, State Ministry of Women

and Child Development, Pre-School and Primary Education, School Infrastructure and School Services

and nine Provincial Education Departments (PEA) will be the implementing agencies to the Program.
