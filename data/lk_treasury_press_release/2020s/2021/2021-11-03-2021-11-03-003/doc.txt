PRESS RELEASE

Inclusive Connectivity and Development Project (ICDP)

The Development Policy Framework of the Government has identified the necessity of improvement of

accessibility and connectivity of Rural Sri Lanka by rehabilitation and improvement of rural & provincial roads on

a priority basis. Poorly maintained provincial and rural road network has resulted poor accessibility and

connectivity, poor road safety, as well as high transportation costs for the rural community to access basic

services and economic opportunities. In this context, the government of Sri Lanka has assigned high priority for

constructing 100,000 km of rural roads and connecting them to main roads network while improving market links

and more opportunities along agricultural value chains to the rural community.

Inclusive Connectivity and Development Project (ICDP) will improve 3000 km of growing proportion of the

provincial and rural road network that is in poor condition. This proposed project will complement for the

Government’s 100, 000 km rural road development program. In addition, the project will focus on the

development of smallholder Agriculture Sector by further expanding market links and more business

opportunities. It is planned to bridge the gaps in infrastructure and services in smallholder agriculture sector

such as collection centers, warehouses and cold storage facilities and adequate transport facilities. Accordingly,

this project will help deliver inputs and connect farmers to domestic and international markets while reducing

post-harvest losses. Ultimately, this project will benefit the rural community to enjoy broad range of economic

opportunities and also has access to the infrastructure, social services, and government institutions that are an

essential part of any development success.

The total estimated cost of the ICDP project is USD 570 million. The International Bank for Reconstruction and

Development has agreed to provide USD 500 million. This project will be implemented by the Road Development

Authority (RDA) under the supervision of Ministry of Highways
