PRESS RELEASE

Finance Ministry to facilitate a sustainable

purchasing system for farmers

Minister of Finance Mr. Ravi Karunanayake said that the government has taken speedy actions

to drive the traditional agro based economy into manufacturing economy with foreign

investments to create one million job opportunities in times to come. Under this context, he

urged that it is the responsibility of the relevant state own enterprises to create a competitive

market environment with state intervention for the farmers to get a good price for their

produces.

The Minister also emphasized the needs of shifting the policy of protectionism given for

agricultural produces into competitive market environment where producers of all major crops

are assured one third of their production cost of the crops as profits with state intervention.

Finance minister made this observation when he met a group of Farmer representatives of

Mahaweli H Zone in Huruluwewa in the Anuradhapura district who produces maize and soya

bean. The Minister Agriculture Mr. DumindaDissanayaka and Minister of Rural Economic Affairs

Mr P Harison had accompanied the representatives of the farmer organizations of Huruluwewa.

Secretary to the General Treasury Dr. R.H.S Samaratunga, Anuradhapura District Secretary and

several other related government officials were present at the meeting held at the Finance

ministry.

Minister of Agriculture MrDuminda Dissanayaka said that the government has geared up a two

pronged system of strengthening the local farmers while making the country self-sufficient in

agricultural produces. Presently soya bean is cultivated in 10,000 hectares in the Mahaweli H

zone. It needs to be expanded to cover 15,000 hectares if the country is to be self-sufficient in

Soya bean. But due to non-availability of quality seeds it could not be done. Minister

Dissanayake said that the agricultural ministry would purchase 3% of the produces to use as the

seeds for the next harvest.

Minister Ravi Karunanayake promised to give the fullest support of the General Treasury for a

sustainable purchasing system connecting the farmers directly with the relevant industries. As

suggested by Minister Ravi Karunanayake the ministers Duminda Dissanayake and P Harison

promised the farmer representatives that the government would make the relevant

intervention through the Paddy marketing Board and the Food Promotion Board to arrive at a

direct purchasing mechanism by the Ministry of health to purchase soya bean from the

Mahaweli H Zone farmers for the production of Triposa.

The ministers after having discussed the matter with Health minister Dr Rajitha Senarathna

over the phone agreed to submit a joint Cabinet proposal to reach a tripartite agreement with

ministry health for the direct purchase of Soya bean from the farmers in the Mahaweli H Zone.

As at present the annual production of Soya bean is little over 8000 MT and the Health ministry

would need 5000 MT for manufacturing triposa. The Agricultural ministry through its Food

Promotion Board would also make the intervention to sell the produces at the farm gate to

industries to extract oil while 3 percent of the produce would be purchased for seed promotion

while a sizeable portions goes to the market for consumption.
