However, there was a delay in making such payments as did in the past, in the last Quarter of 2018 due to the uncertainty that hit the country. At the same time the passing of budget 2019 could not be achieved in the year 2018. It was delayed until April 5th, 2019. Consequent to this delay, the sum of due payments at the end of the year 2018 was accumulated unprecedently up to 99 billion rupees. Accordingly, this also caused delay in the settlement of payments of the year 2018.
