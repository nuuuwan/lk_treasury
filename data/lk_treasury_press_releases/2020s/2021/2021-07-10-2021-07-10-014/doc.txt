The Government of Sri Lanka is planning to borrow two loans amounting to USD 150 million from

The proposed total financial assistance from ADB is comprised of USD 84 million under Asia

Pacific Vaccine Access Facility (APVAX) and USD 66 million from the regular country allocation.

The loan funds will be used to meet the cost of vaccines and also for several other associated

activities including establishment of vaccine related monitoring systems, providing cold chain

related transport facilities and strengthening medical waste management. The total project cost is
