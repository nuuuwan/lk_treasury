Trust and Company Service Providers Medium Low Insurance Medium Low The overall ML/TF risk for the country was assessed as Medium. Based on the NRA, the National Policy on Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) of Sri Lanka and comprehensive action plans for each stakeholder were prepared to address the gaps identified to effectively combat ML/TF in the country. The AML/CFT National Policy and the stakeholder-wise Action Plans were approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on 07.08.2023. Some of the recommendations made in the NRA includes bringing necessary amendments to relevant laws, introduction of new laws, strengthening institutional framework, capacity building for investigators, prosecutors, judiciary, supervisors and increasing supervision of Designated Non-Finance Businesses and Professions, such as Real Estate Agents, Dealers in Precious Metals and Stones, Casinos, Accountants and Lawyers etc. Further, the need for development of comprehensive databases and taking actions to expedite the prosecutions and convictions on ML/TF were also identified, while improving the interagency co-operation in the fight against ML/TF, was also recommended. A copy of the sanitized version of the NRA Report is available on the FIU website at http://fiusrilanka.gov.lk and on the Ministry of Finance, Economic Stabilization and National Policies website at https://www.treasury.gov.lk. The NRA 2021/22 is the second of such Assessments on Sri Lanka’s AML/CFT framework since the first Assessment in 2014. The assessment covers the period from 2016-2022 and relevant data and statistics were sourced from all stakeholder agencies, some of which were represented in the core working groups. Sri Lanka received technical assistance and the tool kit from the World Bank to carry out the NRA. The NRA is an important step for any jurisdiction to identify, assess and understand its threats and vulnerabilities exposing the country to ML/TF risks and the offences generating the most proceeds of crime. This Assessment is an important resource available to both the public and the private sectors to understand the current illicit finance environment and to educate them of risk mitigation strategies. The present Assessment underscores the Government’s commitment to protecting the country’s economy and the financial system from exploitation by a variety of criminal elements and national security threats, and to ensuring a safe and sound financial system by adopting measures to adequately address the threats posed by ML/TF. A strong political commitment is critical to address the national AML/CFT plan and the government is committed to fostering a culture of accountability, transparency, integrity in tackling financial crimes, bribery, corruption, ML and TF in the country.
